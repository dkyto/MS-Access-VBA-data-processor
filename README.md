# MS-Access-VBA-data-processor
<p>This is a cood project I started since 2014 for my work that involved processing a lot of SAP text data into MS-access, in a world when data preparation was not as handy as it is today. The objective of this tool written purely in VBA on MS-access platform, is to create a simple tool for</p>
<ul>
  <li>Import data into MS-access database / SQL server, format range from excel spreadsheets, unconverted text-file spool export from SAP, Queries output from SAP Business Explorer, etc.</li>
  <li>Sequentially Run MS-Access Queries to process data into output./li>
  <li>Delete data from Database for next imports / re-run analysing routine for new data.</li>
  <li>Export queries into new MS-Access database as Table, and, Spreadsheets for other analytics purpose</li>  
</ul>
<p>The tool also comes with a simple code import / export support to facilitate upgrade of function without moving data from one database to another.</p>
<p>Being still the only one contributing to enhence the tool based on my work need, I see the potential that this tool could also help in automating quite a few office report preparation tasks to avoid alot of vlookup, formula error. It was also a very helpful tool to format data in the scenario of data-migrations.</p>
<p>If it have ever saved me a-lot of time in those tasks, I hope it could help you too.</p>
